# Hi, I'm Rahul! ðŸ‘‹

I am a programmer, software developer and a technology enthusiast. My programming mother tongue is Java but I also like to code C, Javascript as well as Python.

I have worked with Deloitte USI as a Java developer for 3 years. Currently, I am pursuing Masters degree in Applied Computer Science at Schmalkalden University of Applied Sciences and upgrading my Cloud and Data skills.

Please checkout my fun projects here on github and let me know if you liked them or not.
